## Description of our project's idea
Cobalt is an all-in-one digital platform designed to simplify access to everyday services. Many people struggle to find reliable service providers quickly, whether they need a haircut, home repair, cleaning, or other personal services. Our platform brings together service providers from multiple industries into one easy-to-use app. Users can search, compare, and book services based on their needs, location, availability, and reviews. The platform saves time, reduces stress, and creates new opportunities for service providers to reach customers. QuickFix is built for modern, busy people who value speed, convenience, and reliability in solving everyday tasks.
## What problem does our idea solve?
People struggle to quickly find and book reliable service providers due to fragmented information, lack of objective comparisons, and unverified reviews. Services are scattered across social media, messaging apps, and multiple websites, making it difficult to assess quality, availability, and pricing in a transparent way. As a result, users waste time searching, comparing subjective opinions, and manually coordinating schedules, while service providers lose potential clients due to poor visibility and inefficient booking processes.
